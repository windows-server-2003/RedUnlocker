# RedUnlocker 
## Description
These GM9 scripts will unlock the red permission in GodMode9 with only the blue one

Each script is for each version of GodMode9. __DO NOT USE WRONG VERSION__ or you'll write to unexpected location in RAM and may **BRICK** your console

Use this at your own risk. I am not responsible for anything.

## Requirement
For now, Godmode9 version 1.4.0 to 1.4.3
